            <p>
              Welcome to The Rust Programming Language, an introductory book about
              Rust. The Rust programming language helps you write faster, more
              reliable software. High-level ergonomics and low-level control are
              often at odds in programming language design; Rust challenges that
              conflict. Through balancing powerful technical capacity and a great
              developer experience, Rust gives you the option to control low-level
              details (such as memory usage) without all the hassle traditionally
              associated with such control.
